## About the Author

As a developer deeply interested in productivity enhancement through AI tools, I share knowledge verified not in theory but in practice, based on my experience building and operating an 11-agent AI system for an actual blog project.

This book contains the know-how and lessons learned from creating 71 blog posts.
