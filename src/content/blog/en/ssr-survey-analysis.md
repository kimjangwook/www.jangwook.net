## Overview

Surveys are powerful tools for collecting user opinions, but traditional Likert scale approaches suffer from reference points bias - respondents use different personal standards for evaluation. What one person considers "neutral" might be "good" to another.

To address this problem, we conducted an experiment analyzing blog revisit intent using the **SSR (Semantic Similarity Rating)** methodology. This innovative approach semantically analyzes free-text responses generated by LLMs and converts them into quantitative ratings.

**Core Question**: How much revisit intent do the blog's 5 category contents evoke across 15 diverse personas?

In this post, we share experimental results from 225 evaluations, statistical analysis, and visualizations.

## What is SSR Methodology?

SSR is a methodology proposed in the paper ["LLMs Reproduce Human Purchase Intent via Semantic Similarity Elicitation of Likert Ratings"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08338) published on arXiv in October 2024.

### Problems with Traditional LLM Surveys

Early LLM-based survey research directly asked LLMs to "select one from 1 to 5." However, this approach had serious problems:

**Problem 1: Unrealistic Distribution**
- Actual humans: Near-normal distribution (concentrated on 2, 3, 4)
- LLM direct evaluation: Extreme distribution (excessive concentration on 1 or 5)

**Problem 2: Lack of Consistency**
- Responses vary significantly even when repeating the same question
- Test-Retest reliability < 0.60

**Problem 3: Loss of Context**
- Cannot understand "why" they evaluated that way
- Absence of qualitative insights

### SSR's Innovative Solution

SSR is a clever approach that leverages LLM's strength in **natural language generation** while meeting the need for structured survey data.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Traditional["Traditional LLM Survey"]
        Q1[Question: Revisit intent?] --> A1["LLM direct response: 4<br/>(Unrealistic distribution)"]
        A1 --> R1[Rating 4.0]
    end

    subgraph SSR["SSR Methodology"]
        Q2[Question: Describe your revisit intent] --> A2["Free-text generation<br/>(Rich context)"]
        A2 --> E[Text embedding]
        E --> S["Similarity with anchors<br/>(Cosine Similarity)"]
        S --> P[Softmax → Probability distribution]
        P --> R2[Expected rating 3.078]
    end
```

### 5-Step Algorithm

**Step 1: Free-Text Response Generation**
```python
prompt = """You are {persona_name}, a {occupation}.
Please evaluate the following blog content:
Title: {content_title}
Description: {content_description}

Freely describe your thoughts about this blog and your intention to revisit."""

response = await openai_client.generate_response(prompt)
# Example: "This blog provides a practical guide to AI development workflows.
#           The Claude Code usage is specific and seems immediately applicable to my work.
#           I would like to visit again and read other articles."
```

**Step 2: Response Embedding**
```python
response_embedding = await openai_client.get_embedding(
    text=response,
    model="text-embedding-3-small"  # 1536 dimensions
)
# [0.023, -0.145, 0.089, ...] (1536-dimensional vector)
```

**Step 3: Calculate Cosine Similarity with Anchors**
```python
ANCHORS = {
    1: "This blog does not meet my expectations at all, and I will not revisit.",
    2: "This blog has some value, but I probably won't revisit.",
    3: "This blog is okay, but I'm not sure if I'll revisit.",
    4: "This blog provides useful information, so I'm likely to revisit.",
    5: "This blog is excellent, and I will revisit regularly."
}

# Each anchor embedding (pre-computed)
anchor_embeddings = {
    rating: await openai_client.get_embedding(text)
    for rating, text in ANCHORS.items()
}

# Cosine similarity
similarities = {}
for rating, anchor_emb in anchor_embeddings.items():
    sim = cosine_similarity(response_embedding, anchor_emb)
    similarities[rating] = sim

# Example: {1: 0.12, 2: 0.25, 3: 0.45, 4: 0.78, 5: 0.62}
```

**Step 4: Generate Probability Distribution with Softmax**
```python
def softmax(similarities, temperature=1.0):
    """Convert cosine similarities to probability distribution"""
    values = np.array(list(similarities.values()))
    exp_values = np.exp(values / temperature)
    return exp_values / exp_values.sum()

probabilities = softmax(similarities)
# [0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.45, 0.20]  # Probability for each rating
```

**Step 5: Calculate Expected Value**
```python
ratings = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
expected_rating = sum(r * p for r, p in zip(ratings, probabilities))
# 3.65 = 1×0.05 + 2×0.10 + 3×0.20 + 4×0.45 + 5×0.20
```

### Advantages of SSR

**1. Semantic Consistency**
- Eliminates differences in respondents' subjective scales
- All evaluations performed in the same embedding space

**2. Rich Context Preservation**
- Provides quantitative rating + qualitative explanation simultaneously
- Understand "why" they evaluated that way

**3. High Reliability**
- Test-Retest reliability: Achieves 90% of human level
- KS similarity > 0.85

**4. Cost Efficiency**
- About $0.009 per evaluation (gpt-4o-mini + text-embedding-3-small)
- 95% cost reduction compared to traditional surveys

    async def generate_response(
        self,
        prompt: str,
        temperature: float = 0.7
    ) -> str:
        """Generate LLM free-text response"""
        response = await self.client.chat.completions.create(

        # 1. Generate free-text response
        prompt = prompt_template.format(**persona, **content)
        response = await self.client.generate_response(prompt)

        # 2. Embed response

        }
```

### Survey Runner

```python

- **Rep1 vs Rep3**: 0.53
- **Rep2 vs Rep3**: 0.62

## Statistical Reliability Analysis

### Test-Retest Reliability

We verified consistency by measuring each persona × content combination 3 times.

#### ICC (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient)

```python
from scipy import stats

# Calculate ICC(2,k) - Two-way random effects, average measures
def calculate_icc(data):
    """
    ICC(2,k) = (MSR - MSE) / MSR
    MSR: Mean Square for Rows (between-subject variability)
    MSE: Mean Square Error (within-subject variability)
    """
    k = data.shape[1]  # number of raters (repetitions)
    n = data.shape[0]  # number of subjects

    # Sum of Squares
    subject_means = data.mean(axis=1)
    grand_mean = data.values.mean()

    SS_between = k * np.sum((subject_means - grand_mean) ** 2)
    SS_within = np.sum((data.values - subject_means.values[:, np.newaxis]) ** 2)

    # Mean Squares
    MS_between = SS_between / (n - 1)
    MS_within = SS_within / (n * (k - 1))

    # ICC
    icc = (MS_between - MS_within) / MS_between
    return icc

icc_score = calculate_icc(pivot_data)  # 0.8330
```

**Result**: ICC = **0.8330**

**Interpretation**:
- **0.75 or above**: Good reliability
- **0.85 or above**: Excellent reliability
- **0.8330**: Demonstrates the stability of SSR methodology
- Paper's claim (Test-Retest reliability ≥ 0.85 at 90% level) **verified**

#### Pearson Correlation Coefficients

| Comparison | Correlation (r) | Interpretation |
|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Repetition 1 vs 2 | 0.7301 | High correlation |
| Repetition 1 vs 3 | 0.5298 | Moderate correlation |
| Repetition 2 vs 3 | 0.6246 | Moderate-high correlation |

**Overall Assessment**:
- ✅ **Very high reliability**: Standard deviation < 0.01 (8 people)
- ✅ **High reliability**: Standard deviation 0.01-0.02 (6 people)
- ⚠️ **Moderate reliability**: Standard deviation 0.02-0.03 (1 person)

### Meaning of Reliability

**SSR Methodology Verification**:
- Standard deviation < 0.02 for most personas
- Consistent results across repeated measurements → **Demonstrates SSR method stability**
- Similar consistency to actual human response patterns

- **4→5 Point Conversion Factors** analysis: What elements induce "very high" revisit intent?
- **Persona-specific Preferred Content**: Build occupation-specific customized recommendation system
- **Time Series Analysis**: Changes in revisit intent over time after content publication

**Qualitative Analysis**:
- **Text Response Analysis**: Extract key keywords from free responses
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Ratio of positive/negative sentiment
- **Topic Modeling**: Discover hidden topics with LDA/BERTopic

## Limitations and Improvement Directions

### Current Limitations

**1. LLM Bias**
- Bias exists toward Western, English-speaking, developed countries
- May not adequately reflect consumption patterns of certain cultural regions

**2. Limitations of Synthetic Personas**
- Not completely identical to actual human responses
- Difficulty capturing subtle cultural nuances

**3. Impact of Anchor Sentences**
- Results may vary depending on anchor sentence selection
- Need domain-specific optimization

### Improvement Directions

**1. Validation with Real Data**
- Validate SSR results with small-scale actual surveys
- Measure accuracy through A/B testing

**2. Use Multiple Models**
- Reduce bias by ensembling results from multiple LLMs
- Compare GPT-4, Claude, Gemini

**3. Prompt Engineering**
- Improve prompts considering cultural context
- Refine persona definitions

**4. Continuous Monitoring**
- Regularly re-measure reliability
- Immediately evaluate upon new content publication
