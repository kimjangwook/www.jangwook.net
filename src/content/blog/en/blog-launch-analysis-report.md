# www.jangwook.net Blog Launch Analysis Report

> **Transparency Declaration**: This report is an honest record of the early launch stage. Instead of impressive numbers, I'm sharing actual data and the learning process as it is.

## 1. Overview

### Background of Blog Launch

In October 2025, I officially launched www.jangwook.net, a technical blog based on Astro 5.14. This blog is designed to be more than just a technical blog - it's a **platform that realizes content automation, SEO optimization, and data-driven decision making**.

**Key Differentiators**:

- üåè **Multilingual Support**: Korean, English, and Japanese content
- üìä **GA4 MCP Integration**: Automated analysis using Google Analytics MCP
- üöÄ **Islands Architecture**: Ultra-fast static site based on Astro
- üîÑ **Automated Reporting**: Data-driven content strategy

### Analysis Environment

- **GA4 Property ID**: 395101361
- **Property Name**: www.jangwook.net
- **Analysis Tools**: Google Analytics 4 (MCP Integration)
- **Analysis Date**: October 6, 2025
- **Time Zone**: Asia/Tokyo (JST)
- **Currency**: USD
- **Data Collection Start**: July 2023 (Property creation date)

### Current Status: Early Data Collection Phase

At the time of writing this report, GA4 is installed, but due to a 24-48 hour data processing delay, **historical data has not yet been collected**.

However, **real-time data** is being collected normally, allowing us to observe current user behavior.

**Data Processing Pipeline**:

```
Real-time Collection (0-5 min delay)
    ‚Üì
Real-time Reports (Immediately queryable) ‚Üê Current stage
    ‚Üì
Batch Processing (24-48 hours)
    ‚Üì
Standard Reports (Historical analysis available) ‚Üê Waiting
```

## 2. Real-time Data Analysis

### 2.1 Current Active Users

Real-time data collected at the time of analysis:

**Activity by Page**:

- **EffiFlow**: 4 pageviews, 1 active user
- **Contact**: 2 pageviews, 1 active user
- **Blog**: 2 pageviews, 1 active user
- **About**: 2 pageviews, 1 active user
- **Social**: 2 pageviews, 1 active user

**Device Distribution**:

- Desktop: Main traffic (Japan region)
- Mobile: Small amount of traffic (no region info)

**Geographic Distribution**:

- Japan: Source of all desktop traffic

### 2.2 Initial Observations

**Positive Signals**:

1. **Diverse Page Navigation**: Users visit multiple pages instead of staying on a single page
2. **EffiFlow Page Engagement**: High interest in specific project page (4 pageviews)
3. **Navigation Usage**: Exploration of various sections like Contact, About, Social

**Areas for Improvement**:

1. **Traffic Source Diversification**: Currently focused on single region (Japan)
2. **Mobile Optimization**: Very little mobile traffic
3. **Tracking Expansion**: Need more sophisticated event tracking

## 3. Practical GA4 MCP Query Examples

### 3.1 Ready-to-Execute Analysis Queries

For readers starting blog analysis, I'm sharing **actually usable MCP query examples**.

#### Query 1: Real-time Visitor Status

```javascript
// Who's on your blog right now?
mcp__analytics -
  mcp__run_realtime_report({
    property_id: 395101361,
    dimensions: ["unifiedScreenName", "country"],
    metrics: ["activeUsers"],
  });
```

**Result Interpretation**:

- Current active user count
- Which pages they're viewing
- Which country they're from

#### Query 2: Last 7 Days Traffic Trend

```javascript
// How's the weekly growth?
mcp__analytics -
  mcp__run_report({
    property_id: 395101361,
    date_ranges: [{ start_date: "7daysAgo", end_date: "today" }],
    dimensions: ["date"],
    metrics: ["activeUsers", "sessions", "screenPageViews"],
    order_bys: [
      { dimension: { dimension_name: "date", order_type: 1 }, desc: true },
    ],
  });
```

**How to Use**:

- Identify daily traffic patterns
- Analyze weekend vs weekday differences
- Confirm growth trends

#### Query 3: Top 10 Popular Blog Posts

```javascript
// Which content is performing best?
mcp__analytics -
  mcp__run_report({
    property_id: 395101361,
    date_ranges: [{ start_date: "30daysAgo", end_date: "today" }],
    dimensions: ["pagePath", "pageTitle"],
    metrics: ["screenPageViews", "activeUsers", "userEngagementDuration"],
    dimension_filter: {
      filter: {
        field_name: "pagePath",
        string_filter: {
          match_type: 2,
          value: "/blog/",
          case_sensitive: false,
        },
      },
    },
    order_bys: [{ metric: { metric_name: "screenPageViews" }, desc: true }],
    limit: 10,
  });
```

**Analysis Points**:

- screenPageViews: Popularity
- activeUsers: Reach
- userEngagementDuration: Content quality

#### Query 4: Traffic Source Analysis

```javascript
// Where are your visitors coming from?
mcp__analytics -
  mcp__run_report({

    dimensions: ["sessionDefaultChannelGroup", "sessionSource"],
    metrics: ["sessions", "bounceRate", "averageSessionDuration"],
    order_bys: [{ metric: { metric_name: "sessions" }, desc: true }],
  });
```

### 9.2 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q1: GA4 data appears differently in MCP and UI**
A: Consider 24-48 hour data processing delay. Real-time reports are immediate, standard reports are delayed.

**Q2: Which metrics should I focus on?**
A: For the first 3 months, focus on **Monthly Active Readers (MAR)** and **Organic Search %**. These two metrics best represent blog health.

**Q3: I'm not meeting benchmark numbers - is it a failure?**
A: **Growth trends** are more important than absolute numbers. If you maintain 10% week-over-week growth, you can achieve targets within 3 months.

**Q4: How much time should I invest in analysis?**
A:

- Daily: 5 min (real-time check)
- Weekly: 30 min (weekly report)
- Monthly: 2 hours (strategy review)

**Q5: What's the key to multilingual blog analysis?**
A: Set **independent benchmarks** for each language. Korean and English content operate in different markets and competitive environments.
