In the previous post, we explored what OpenClaw is. This time, we'll go through <strong>installing it and having your first conversation</strong> — all in one go. Open your terminal and follow along! 🚀

---

## 1. Prerequisites

OpenClaw runs on the Node.js runtime.

| Item | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| <strong>Node.js</strong> | v22 or above (check with `node -v`) |
| <strong>OS</strong> | Windows, macOS, and Linux all supported |

- <strong>macOS / Linux</strong> — You can start right away without any additional setup.
- <strong>Windows</strong> — Works natively. WSL2 is also supported but not required.

If you don't have Node.js, download the LTS version (22+) from the [official site](https://nodejs.org/), or use a version manager:

```bash
# Volta (recommended — per-project version management)
curl https://get.volta.sh | bash
volta install node@22

# nvm
nvm install 22
nvm use 22

# fnm
fnm install 22
fnm use 22
```

### Optional (But Recommended!)

- <strong>Brave Search API Key</strong> — Required for web search features. Get one free at [Brave Search API](https://brave.com/search/api/)
- <strong>AI Model API Key</strong> — At least one of Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google. Set via `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variables
- <strong>Git</strong> — Required for source builds

---

## 2. Installation — 3 Methods

Choose whichever method suits you best.

### Method 1: npm Global Install (Most Recommended) ⭐

```bash
npm install -g openclaw@latest
# or
pnpm add -g openclaw@latest
```

Verify the installation:
```bash
openclaw --version
```

### Method 2: One-Click Script (Quick & Easy)

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
iwr -useb https://openclaw.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

The script handles everything from dependency checks to PATH registration.

### Method 3: Source Build (For Contributors)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw.git
cd openclaw
pnpm install
pnpm ui:build    # Automatically installs UI dependencies on first run
pnpm build
openclaw onboard --install-daemon
```

> <strong>Tip:</strong> Source builds are recommended if you're thinking about contributing or want to try the latest features early. Switching between npm and source builds is easy — `openclaw doctor` automatically updates the Gateway service entrypoint.

---

## 3. Onboarding Wizard — Core Setup in One Go

After installation, the onboarding wizard guides you through core settings on first run.

```bash
openclaw onboard --install-daemon
```

Follow the interactive prompts to configure these items:

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| <strong>Gateway</strong> | Always-on daemon where the AI agent resides |
| <strong>Authentication</strong> | AI model API keys (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.) |
| <strong>Channels</strong> | Messaging platforms like Telegram, Discord |
| <strong>Workspace</strong> | File workspace path for the agent |
| <strong>Gateway Token</strong> | Generated by default by the wizard (even for loopback) |

Adding the `--install-daemon` flag registers the Gateway as an OS service:
- <strong>macOS</strong>: launchd
- <strong>Linux</strong>: systemd user service
- <strong>Windows</strong>: Windows Service

It auto-starts after reboots, so no need to worry.

### Manual Setup Without the Wizard

You can also directly edit `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` instead of using the wizard:

```json5
{
  // AI model settings
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "workspace": "~/.openclaw/workspace",
      "models": {
        "default": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
      }
    }
  },
  
  // Channel settings
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "botToken": "<BotFather token>",
      "dmPolicy": "pairing"
    }
  },
  
  // Automation settings
  "cron": { "enabled": true },
  "hooks": {
    "enabled": true,
    "token": "<webhook_secret>"
  }
}
```

## 4. Telegram Bot Integration — The Easiest Channel

Among all available channels, <strong>Telegram</strong> has the lowest barrier to entry. Let's start there.

### 4-1. Create a Bot

1. Send the `/newbot` command to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram.
2. Choose a bot name and username — you'll receive an <strong>API token</strong>.
3. Copy and save this token.

### 4-2. Register the Token in Config

Skip this if you already registered it during the onboarding wizard. Manual setup:

```json5
{
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "botToken": "7123456789:AAHx...",
      "dmPolicy": "pairing"
    }
  }
}
```

**`dmPolicy` Options Explained:**

| Policy | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `pairing` | Requires pairing approval (<strong>strongly recommended</strong> for security ⭐) |
| `open` | Anyone can DM (for testing) |
| `deny` | Block all DMs |

### 4-3. Pairing Approval

When you first DM the bot, a <strong>pairing request</strong> is generated. Approve it from the terminal:

```bash
# Check pending pairing requests
openclaw pairing list

# Approve pairing
openclaw pairing approve <requestID>
```

You can also approve visually from the dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:18789/`.

### 4-4. Using in Telegram Groups

Invite the bot to a group and it works in <strong>mention-based</strong> mode:

```json5
{
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "botToken": "7123456789:AAHx...",
      "groups": {
        "*": { "requireMention": true }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- `@botname What's wrong with this code?` → AI responds
- Regular conversation → AI observes silently

### 4-5. Advanced Telegram Settings

```json5
{
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "botToken": "7123456789:AAHx...",
      "dmPolicy": "pairing",
      "streaming": {
        "enabled": true,          // Real-time response streaming
        "draftMode": true         // Show typing indicator
      },
      "reactions": {
        "mode": "minimal"         // Minimize emoji reactions
      },
      "topics": true              // Forum topic support
    }
  }
}
```

## 5. Running and Verifying the Gateway

If you installed the daemon during onboarding, it may already be running.

### Service Management

```bash
# Check status
openclaw gateway status

# Start/Stop/Restart
openclaw gateway start
openclaw gateway stop
openclaw gateway restart
```

### Manual Execution (For Debugging)

```bash
openclaw gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

The `--verbose` flag outputs request/response logs in real time.

### Remote Access (Tailscale)

To access the Gateway from outside your home:

```bash
openclaw gateway --bind tailnet --token <token>
```

A token is <strong>required</strong> for non-local bindings.

### Status Checks

```bash
# Full status
openclaw status

# Environment diagnostics
openclaw doctor

# Health check
openclaw health
```

Visit <strong>http://127.0.0.1:18789/</strong> in your browser to visually check the running state, channel connections, recent conversations, and more through the dashboard.

## 6. First Conversation Test 🎉

Everything is ready. Let's have an actual conversation.

### Chat Directly on Telegram

Send any message to the bot from your paired account. If the AI agent responds, you're all set! 🎊

### Test via CLI

```bash
# Send a message to a specific Telegram chat
openclaw message send --target telegram:<chatID> --message "Hello, OpenClaw!"

# You can also test from the dashboard
# Use WebChat at http://127.0.0.1:18789/
```

### Slash Commands

Built-in commands you can use directly in Telegram chats:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/status` | Check Gateway status |
| `/model <model>` | Change AI model |
| `/thinking <level>` | Adjust thinking level (off/low/medium/high) |
| `/stop` | Stop the currently running task |
| `/subagents list` | List sub-agents |
| `/activation always\|mention` | Change response mode in groups |

---

## 7. Workspace Setup — Building Your Agent's Brain

Now that it's working, let's customize it into <strong>an agent tailored to you</strong>.

### Workspace File Structure

```
~/.openclaw/workspace/
├── AGENTS.md        # Agent behavior rules and workflows
├── SOUL.md          # Persona, personality, and tone definitions
├── USER.md          # Information about the user (you)
├── MEMORY.md        # Long-term memory — persists across sessions
├── HEARTBEAT.md     # Items to auto-check on heartbeat
├── TOOLS.md         # Local notes for tools (camera names, SSH info, etc.)
├── memory/          # Daily memory logs
│   ├── 2025-07-12.md
│   └── 2025-07-13.md
└── skills/          # Custom skills folder
    └── my-skill/
        └── SKILL.md
```

### SOUL.md — Defining the Agent's Personality

Define the agent's character in this file:

```markdown
# SOUL.md

## Personality
- Friendly but professional tone
- Communicate in English (keep technical terms as-is)
- Use emojis moderately 😊
- Good sense of humor, but avoid TMI

## Name
I am "Claudie" — A personal AI assistant powered by OpenClaw

## Principles
- Only provide accurate information; be honest when unsure
- Always provide code in complete, runnable form
- Strictly protect personal information
```

### USER.md — User Information

```markdown
# USER.md

## Basic Info
- Name: John Smith
- Occupation: Software Engineer
- Interests: AI, automation, developer productivity
- Timezone: America/New_York (UTC-5)

## Preferences
- Keep responses concise
- Prefer TypeScript for code
- Use Google Calendar for scheduling
```

### HEARTBEAT.md — Automated Checklist

Define items for the agent to automatically check periodically:

```markdown
# HEARTBEAT.md

## Regular Checks (every heartbeat)
- [ ] Notify about any urgent unread emails
- [ ] Remind about calendar events within 2 hours
- [ ] Alert if rain is forecast — bring an umbrella
- [ ] Summarize new Issues/PRs in GitHub repos

## Nighttime (23:00-08:00)
- Only notify for urgent items; otherwise HEARTBEAT_OK
```

### Changing Models

```bash
# Change default model via CLI
openclaw config set agents.defaults.models.default "anthropic/claude-opus-4-20250514"

# Or use slash commands in Telegram
/model opus
/model sonnet
/model gpt-4o
```

## 8. Installing Skills

Install community skills from ClawHub:

![ClawHub — Search and install skills. Browse popular skills like Trello, Calendar, Slack, and more](../../../assets/blog/clawhub-main.png)

```bash
# Install CalDAV calendar integration skill
npx clawhub@latest install caldav-calendar

# Trello board management skill
npx clawhub@latest install trello

# Check installed skills
ls ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/
```

Installed skills are automatically recognized. They <strong>hot-reload</strong> without restarting the Gateway.

---

## 9. Troubleshooting — Problem-Solving Guide

### Automatic Diagnostics

```bash
# Auto-diagnose the entire environment
openclaw doctor

# Output detailed status of all components
openclaw status --all
```

`openclaw doctor` inspects Node.js version, config file validity, channel connections, API key status, and more — all at once.

### Common Problems and Solutions

| Symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| Gateway won't start | Port conflict | `netstat -ano \| findstr 18789` (Windows) / `lsof -i :18789` (macOS/Linux) |
| Telegram bot not responding | Token error or incomplete pairing | Check with `openclaw doctor`, verify approval status with `openclaw pairing list` |
| API key error | Key expired or insufficient balance | Check key status with `openclaw doctor`, verify on model provider dashboard |
| "Node version" error | Node.js below v22 | Check with `node -v` and upgrade |
| Skill not recognized | Hot-reload delay | Wait briefly after saving `SKILL.md`, or restart Gateway |

### Checking Logs

```bash
# Monitor Gateway logs in real time (macOS/Linux)
tail -f ~/.openclaw/logs/gateway.log

# Windows PowerShell
Get-Content ~/.openclaw/logs/gateway.log -Wait -Tail 50
```
