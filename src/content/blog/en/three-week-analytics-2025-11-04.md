## 💡 Key Insights

### 1. 🚀 Organic Search 1266% Explosion: SEO Compound Effect

**Data**: Week 1: 2 people (4.3%) → Weeks 2-4: 109 people (54.4%)

The SEO infrastructure built in Week 1 (Google Search Console, sitemap, Schema.org) became the foundation, and publishing 20 new posts over 3 weeks exponentially increased searchable pages.

### 2. 🇰🇷 South Korea's Dramatic Rise: Power of Localized Content

With **shortage of Korean content** on latest AI technologies like Claude Code, OpenAI AgentKit, and LangGraph, this blog started appearing at the top of search results.

### 3. 📉 Pages/Session 75% Drop: Internal Link Strategy Failure

Most visitors **view only a single page before leaving**. Internal link deficiency and content depth issues are problematic.

### 4. 📱 Mobile Dwell Time 2x: Unexpected Discovery

Desktop: 0:56 vs Mobile: 1:51 (**2x difference**)

Data showing mobile users staying 2x longer overturns previous assumptions. Mobile optimization priority needs reconsideration.

### 5. 🔄 Return Rate 79% Drop: Evidence of Growth Pain

Return rate "percentage" dropped, but **absolute numbers increased 400%**. This is not "failure" but **"growth pain"**.
