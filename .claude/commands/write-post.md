# Write Post Command

## Description

Automatically generates blog posts with multi-language support, SEO optimization, and hero image generation. This command orchestrates the Writing Assistant agent to create complete, publication-ready blog posts.

## Usage

```bash
/write-post <topic> [options]
```

## Parameters

### Required

- `topic` (string): The main topic/subject of the blog post

### Optional

- `--tags` (string): Comma-separated list of tags (e.g., "nextjs,react,typescript")
- `--languages` (string): Comma-separated language codes (default: "ko,ja,en,zh")
  - Available: ko (Korean), ja (Japanese), en (English), zh (Simplified Chinese)
  - **All 4 languages must be generated for every post**
- `--description` (string): SEO-optimized description (150-160 characters recommended)

## Examples

```bash
# Basic usage (generates Korean, Japanese, English, and Chinese versions)
/write-post "Next.js 15의 새로운 기능"

# With tags
/write-post "React 커스텀 훅 가이드" --tags react,hooks,javascript

# With specific languages
/write-post "TypeScript 고급 타입 활용법" --tags typescript,types --languages ko,ja,zh

# With custom description
/write-post "Astro로 블로그 만들기" --tags astro,blog --description "Astro 프레임워크를 사용하여 고성능 블로그를 구축하는 완벽 가이드"

# All options combined
/write-post "Tailwind CSS 최적화 전략" --tags tailwind,css,performance --languages ko,ja,en,zh --description "Tailwind CSS를 사용한 프로젝트에서 성능을 극대화하는 실전 최적화 기법"
```

## Workflow

### 1. Input Parsing

- Parse topic and all optional parameters
- Validate language codes (ko, ja, en, zh)
- Sanitize tags (lowercase, alphanumeric, hyphens only)
- Generate default description if not provided

### 2. Writing Assistant Invocation

The command delegates to the Writing Assistant agent with the following tasks:

#### Phase 1: Research & Planning

- Analyze the topic and identify key points
- **Research current information using Web Researcher agent**:
  - Use Brave Search MCP to gather latest information
  - **IMPORTANT: Implement 2-second delay between search requests to avoid rate limiting**
  - Verify technical accuracy from official documentation
  - Identify trending discussions and best practices
  - Collect code examples from reliable sources
- Create content structure and outline based on research findings
- Identify additional code examples and technical details needed

#### Phase 2: Image Generation (Hero + In-Content Images)

**Hero Image**:
- Generate a **context-specific, detailed** hero image prompt (see Image Prompt Guidelines below)
- Call Image Generator agent to create hero image
- Save image to appropriate path: `src/assets/blog/[slug]-hero.[ext]`
- Store image metadata for frontmatter

**In-Content Images** (screenshots, diagrams, illustrations):
- Identify sections in the content that benefit from visual explanation (architecture diagrams, UI screenshots, workflow illustrations, comparison charts)
- For each identified section, either:
  - **Generate**: Create additional images via Image Generator for conceptual illustrations
    - Save to `src/assets/blog/[slug]-[section-name].[ext]`
    - Reference in markdown: `![alt text](../../../assets/blog/[slug]-[section-name].[ext])`
  - **Download from official sources**: When the blog references official documentation, tools, or services that have relevant screenshots/diagrams:
    - Download the image directly from the official source URL
    - Save to `src/assets/blog/[slug]-[descriptive-name].[ext]`
    - Add proper attribution in alt text or caption (e.g., `![Next.js App Router structure (출처: Next.js 공식 문서)](...)`)
    - Prefer official docs images for: UI screenshots, architecture diagrams from docs, official logos/badges, configuration panels
    - Use `curl` or `node` to download: `curl -o src/assets/blog/[slug]-[name].png "https://docs.example.com/image.png"`
- **Goal**: Every blog post should have **at least 2-3 images** (hero + 1~2 in-content) for better readability and SEO

#### Phase 3: Content Generation (Korean-First Approach)

**IMPORTANT - Publication Date**:

- Find the most recent post's `pubDate` in `src/content/blog/` across all languages
- Calculate two candidates:
  - **Candidate A**: Latest existing post's pubDate + 1 day
  - **Candidate B**: Today's date + 1 day
- Set `pubDate` to **whichever is later** (max of A and B)
- This ensures no past-dated posts are created even if there's a publishing gap
- Use `python .claude/skills/blog-writing/scripts/get_next_pubdate.py` to auto-calculate
- Format: 'YYYY-MM-DD' (single quotes required)

**IMPORTANT - Korean-First Workflow**:

The content generation follows a **two-stage process**:

**Stage 1: Write Korean Post First**

- Generate the complete Korean blog post with full content
- Include proper Astro frontmatter:
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: [Korean Title]
  description: [Korean SEO Description]
  pubDate: "[Latest Post Date + 1 day]" # Must use single quotes and YYYY-MM-DD format
  heroImage: ../../../assets/blog/[slug]-hero.[ext]
  tags: [tag1, tag2, ...]
  ---
  ```
- This becomes the **source of truth** for all translations
- Apply Korean technical writing style (존댓말, mix of Korean/English terms)
- Include all code examples with Korean comments

**Stage 2: Natural Translation to Other Languages**

Based on the completed Korean post:

- **Japanese (ja)**: Naturally translate to Japanese
  - Use です/ます体 (polite form)
  - Convert to katakana for technical terms
  - Maintain code structure, translate comments

- **English (en)**: Naturally translate to English
  - Use American English spelling
  - Standard technical documentation style
  - Professional but accessible tone

- **Chinese (zh)**: Naturally translate to Chinese
  - Use simplified Chinese (简体中文)
  - Mix Chinese and English technical terms appropriately
  - Professional technical writing style

- Preserve all code examples and formatting
- Maintain technical term consistency across languages
- Keep Mermaid diagrams but translate labels

#### Phase 4: File Operations

- Generate URL-friendly slug from topic
- Save files to appropriate paths:
  - Korean: `/src/content/blog/ko/[slug].md`
  - Japanese: `/src/content/blog/ja/[slug].md`
  - English: `/src/content/blog/en/[slug].md`
  - Chinese: `/src/content/blog/zh/[slug].md`
- Ensure Content Collections schema compliance
- Validate frontmatter required fields

### 3. Quality Checks

- Verify all files created successfully
- Check frontmatter format (title, description, pubDate required)
- Validate image path references
- Ensure proper Markdown formatting
- **Verify `relatedPosts` is present in ALL language versions**:
  - Each file MUST have `relatedPosts` array with 3-5 entries
  - Each entry must have: `slug`, `score` (0-1), `reason` (with ko, ja, en, zh)
  - If missing after recommendation generation, manually add based on `post-metadata.json` analysis
  - **NEVER skip this check** — relatedPosts is mandatory for all posts
- **Verify in-content images exist** (at least 1 besides hero image):
  - Check that `src/assets/blog/[slug]-*` files exist
  - Check that image references in markdown point to valid files

### 4. Update README.md

After successfully creating all blog post files:

- Read `README.md`
- Update the "블로그 포스트 현황" section:
  - Increment total post count
  - Add new post to the top of the list with title, date, and description
  - Update "최신 포스트 날짜" to the new post's pubDate
  - Update "Last Updated" timestamp at the bottom
- If the new post topic was in "향후 콘텐츠 플랜", remove it from that section

### 5. Backlink Management

After successfully creating and documenting the new post, manage backlinks:

#### Phase 1: Find Preview References

- Search all existing blog posts for preview/teaser text mentioning the new post
- Use Grep to search for common preview patterns:
  - Korean: `다음.*예고`, `다음 글`, `다음에는`
  - Japanese: `次回.*予告`, `次回記事`, `次回`
  - English: `Coming Next`, `Next Article Preview`, `Coming Soon`

#### Phase 2: Convert Previews to Links

For each found preview:

- Verify the preview text matches the new post title (70%+ similarity)
- Convert preview text to actual markdown link
- Update all language versions consistently
- Change preview label (e.g., "다음 글 예고" → "다음 글")

**Example conversion**:

```markdown
# Before

**다음 글 예고**: "AI 에이전트 협업 패턴"에서는...

# After

**다음 글**: [AI 에이전트 협업 패턴](/ko/blog/ko/ai-agent-collaboration-patterns)에서는...
```

#### Phase 3: Series Management (if applicable)

If the new post is part of a series:

1. Add series navigation to the top of the post:

   ```markdown
   > **시리즈: [Series Name]** (2/5)
   >
   > 1. [First Post](/link/to/first-post)
   > 2. **[Current Post](/link/to/current-post)** ← 현재 글
   > 3. [Third Post](/link/to/third-post)
   > 4. [Fourth Post](/link/to/fourth-post) (예정)
   > 5. [Fifth Post](/link/to/fifth-post) (예정)
   ```

2. Update series navigation in all other posts in the series
3. Apply to all language versions

#### Delegation to Backlink Manager Agent

```bash
@backlink-manager "[new-post-slug] 포스트에 대한 백링크를 확인하고 연결해주세요."
```

The Backlink Manager agent will:

- Automatically find and convert previews
- Handle series navigation updates
- Ensure consistency across all language versions
- Report all changes made

### 6. Post Metadata Addition (V3)

After successfully creating the blog post and managing backlinks, add post metadata to `post-metadata.json`.

#### Metadata Structure (V3)

**IMPORTANT CHANGE**: In V3, metadata is significantly streamlined to store **only 3 fields**:

```json
{
  "post-slug": {
    "pubDate": "2025-11-04",
    "difficulty": 3,
    "categoryScores": {
      "automation": 0.9,
      "web-development": 0.3,
      "ai-ml": 0.85,
      "devops": 0.5,
      "architecture": 0.75
    }
  }
}
```

**Field Descriptions**:

1. **pubDate** (string, required):

   - Format: 'YYYY-MM-DD'
   - Used for temporal filtering and preventing time-travel in recommendations

2. **difficulty** (number 1-5, required):

   - 1-2: Beginner (Getting Started, basic concepts)
   - 3: Intermediate (practical usage, integration guides)
   - 4-5: Advanced (architecture, optimization, complex systems)

3. **categoryScores** (object, required):
   - automation: Relevance to automation, workflows, CI/CD (0.0-1.0)
   - web-development: Relevance to web dev, frontend, backend (0.0-1.0)
   - ai-ml: Relevance to AI, machine learning, LLMs (0.0-1.0)
   - devops: Relevance to deployment, infrastructure, monitoring (0.0-1.0)
   - architecture: Relevance to system design, architectural patterns (0.0-1.0)

**Score Guidelines**:

- 0.0-0.3: Barely related
- 0.4-0.6: Partially related
- 0.7-0.8: Major topic
- 0.9-1.0: Core topic

#### How to Add Metadata

Manually edit the `post-metadata.json` file to add metadata for the new post:

```json
{
  "existing-post-1": {
    "pubDate": "2025-11-01",
    "difficulty": 2,
    "categoryScores": { ... }
  },
  "new-post-slug": {
    "pubDate": "2025-11-04",
    "difficulty": 3,
    "categoryScores": {
      "automation": 0.9,
      "web-development": 0.3,
      "ai-ml": 0.85,
      "devops": 0.5,
      "architecture": 0.75
    }
  }
}
```

**Important Notes**:

- Use base slug WITHOUT language prefix (e.g., "slack-mcp-team-communication", not "ko/slack-mcp-team-communication")
- All language versions share the same metadata
- pubDate must be latest post + 1 day

### 7. Generate Related Post Recommendations (V3)

After adding metadata, use the V3 recommendation system to generate related posts.

#### V3 System Overview

**Key Changes**:

- ✅ `recommendations.json` file **DEPRECATED** - No more external JSON file needed
- ✅ Read directly from `post-metadata.json` (uses only 3 fields)
- ✅ Store `relatedPosts` array **directly in Frontmatter**
- ✅ Integrated with Content Collections schema
- ✅ Automatically processed by Astro at build time

**Benefits**:

- 62% file size reduction (800 lines → 300 lines)
- 100% elimination of build-time file I/O operations
- 27% code complexity reduction
- Improved data consistency (single source of truth)

#### Running V3 Recommendation Generation

```bash
# Run the script
node scripts/generate-recommendations-v3.js

# Or use npm script (if available)
npm run generate-recommendations
```

**Script Behavior**:

1. Read `post-metadata.json`
2. Calculate similarity for each post:
   - **Difficulty Similarity** (20%): Prefer similar difficulty levels
   - **Category Similarity** (80%): Cosine similarity-based
3. Select top 5 recommendations (score >= 0.3)
4. Write directly to **Frontmatter of all 3 language versions** of each post:

```yaml
---
title: "Post Title"
description: "Description"
pubDate: "2025-11-04"
relatedPosts:
  - slug: ai-agent-notion-mcp-automation
    score: 0.92
    reason:
      ko: "두 포스트 모두 MCP 서버를 활용한 자동화를 다룹니다."
      ja: "両記事ともMCPサーバーを活用した自動化を扱います。"
      en: "Both posts cover MCP server-based automation."
  - slug: google-analytics-mcp-automation
    score: 0.85
    reason:
      ko: "MCP 통합과 데이터 분석 자동화에서 유사합니다."
      ja: "MCP統合とデータ分析自動化で類似しています。"
      en: "Similar in MCP integration and data analysis automation."
---
```

**Important Notes**:

- Script modifies **all 3 language files for every post**
- Not automatically committed to Git - manual commit required
- Backup recommended before running (`git stash` or `git commit`)

## Writing Assistant Delegation

### Context Provided to Agent

```markdown
Task: Generate blog post
Topic: [user-provided topic]
Tags: [tag1, tag2, ...]
Languages: [language codes]
Description: [SEO description or "Generate appropriate description"]

Requirements:

1. **Determine publication date**:

   - Run `python .claude/skills/blog-writing/scripts/get_next_pubdate.py` to auto-calculate
   - OR manually: Find the latest pubDate across all language folders, then pick the **later** of:
     - Latest post's pubDate + 1 day
     - Today's date + 1 day
   - This prevents past-dated posts when there's a publishing gap
   - Format as 'YYYY-MM-DD' (single quotes)

2. Research topic using Web Researcher agent:

   - Delegate to Web Researcher for comprehensive research
   - **CRITICAL: Ensure 2-second delay between search requests**
   - Gather latest information, official documentation, and examples
   - Verify technical accuracy and current best practices
   - Create detailed outline based on research findings

3. Generate images (hero + in-content):

   - **Hero image**: Create a detailed, content-specific image prompt (use 6-part structure: Subject, Style, Composition, Colors, Elements, Constraints). Call Image Generator agent. Save to src/assets/blog/[slug]-hero.[ext]. Use path ../../../assets/blog/[slug]-hero.[ext] in frontmatter.
   - **In-content images**: Identify 1-3 sections that benefit from visual explanation. For each:
     - If conceptual/illustrative → Generate via Image Generator, save as src/assets/blog/[slug]-[section].[ext]
     - If official docs screenshot/diagram → Download directly from source URL using curl/node, save as src/assets/blog/[slug]-[name].[ext], add source attribution
   - Reference in-content images in markdown: `![descriptive alt text](../../../assets/blog/[slug]-[name].[ext])`
   - **Minimum**: Every post must have hero image + at least 1 in-content image

4. Write complete blog post using **KOREAN-FIRST APPROACH**:

   **CRITICAL - Two-Stage Process**:

   The Korean-First approach ensures consistency and natural translation:

   **Stage 1: Write Korean Post First**

   - Write the complete Korean blog post
   - This is the **source of truth** for all translations
   - Include full content, code examples, Mermaid diagrams
   - Save to `/src/content/blog/ko/[slug].md`
   - Verify the Korean post is complete before proceeding

   **Stage 2: Natural Translation to Other Languages (IN PARALLEL)**

   After Korean post is complete:
   - Create 3 separate agents for translation (ja, en, zh)
   - Delegate to **ALL 3 agents** in a single message with 3 Task tool calls
   - Each agent receives the completed Korean post as source
   - Each agent naturally translates to their target language

   **Agent Delegation Pattern**:
```

Stage 1 (Sequential):
- Task: Korean writing agent (ko) - FIRST, write complete post

Stage 2 (Parallel, after Stage 1 completes):
- Task 1: Japanese translation agent (ja) - translate from Korean
- Task 2: English translation agent (en) - translate from Korean
- Task 3: Chinese translation agent (zh) - translate from Korean

````

**Each translation agent must**:
- Receive the complete Korean post as input
- Naturally translate content (NOT machine-translate)
- Follow Astro Content Collections schema
- Include frontmatter (title, description, pubDate, heroImage, tags)
- **Use the same pubDate as Korean version**
- Preserve code examples (translate comments only)
- Translate Mermaid diagram labels
- Apply language-specific SEO optimization
- Save to correct language folder upon completion

5. Save files to **ALL 4 language-specific folders**:

- Korean: /src/content/blog/ko/[slug].md
- Japanese: /src/content/blog/ja/[slug].md
- English: /src/content/blog/en/[slug].md
- Chinese: /src/content/blog/zh/[slug].md

6. **CRITICAL - Verify language count**:
   - Count files in each language folder
   - ALL 4 folders must have equal number of posts
   - If mismatch detected, generate missing language versions

7. Update README.md:

- Read current README.md
- Update "블로그 포스트 현황" section
- Increment post count
- Add new post to top of list
- Update "최신 포스트 날짜"
- Update "Last Updated" timestamp
- Remove topic from "향후 콘텐츠 플랜" if present

8. Manage backlinks:

- Delegate to Backlink Manager agent
- Search existing posts for preview/teaser references
- Convert found previews to active links
- Update series navigation if post is part of a series
- Report all changes made

9. Add post metadata (V3):

- Open post-metadata.json file
- Add metadata for new post:
  ```json
  {
    "new-post-slug": {
      "pubDate": "2025-11-04",
      "difficulty": 3,
      "categoryScores": {
        "automation": 0.9,
        "web-development": 0.3,
        "ai-ml": 0.85,
        "devops": 0.5,
        "architecture": 0.75
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- Determine difficulty and categoryScores based on content analysis
- Save file

10. Generate related post recommendations (V3):

- Run `node scripts/generate-recommendations-v3.js`
- Script will:
  - Read metadata from post-metadata.json
  - Calculate similarity scores (difficulty 20% + categories 80%)
  - Select top 5 related posts
  - Write relatedPosts array to frontmatter of all language versions
- **CRITICAL VERIFICATION after running the script**:
  - Open each generated language file (ko, ja, en, zh) and check that `relatedPosts` exists in frontmatter
  - If `relatedPosts` is missing or empty in ANY file:
    1. Manually analyze post-metadata.json to find the 3-5 most similar posts
    2. Add relatedPosts array directly to the frontmatter with proper slug, score, and multilingual reason
    3. Ensure all 4 language versions have identical relatedPosts entries
  - **This step is NOT optional** — every published post MUST have relatedPosts

11. Generate URL-friendly slug from topic
12. Return file paths and metadata for ALL 4 languages
````

### Expected Agent Response Format

```json

`````

### Style Guidelines
- Use clear, professional technical writing
- Explain technical terms on first use
- Include working code examples
- Use active voice
- Keep paragraphs concise (2-4 sentences)
- Use bullet points for lists
- Add code comments in target language
- **블로그 본문에서 볼드 텍스트는 마크다운 `**text**` 대신 HTML `<strong>text</strong>` 태그를 사용할 것. 이는 특수문자와의 충돌을 방지하기 위함.**

### Markdown Formatting Guidelines

**CRITICAL - Nested Code Blocks**:
When you need to show markdown code blocks that contain triple backticks (```), you MUST use **quadruple backticks (````) for the outer block**. This prevents rendering issues.

**Example**:

❌ **WRONG** (will break rendering):
````markdown
```markdown
## Example
```javascript
const code = 'nested';
`````

```

```

✅ **CORRECT** (use quadruple backticks):

`````markdown
````markdown
## Example

```javascript
const code = "nested";
```
````
`````

**When to Use Quadruple Backticks**:

- When documenting markdown syntax that includes code blocks
- When showing examples of blog post frontmatter with code
- When demonstrating how to write documentation
- Any time the content inside contains triple backticks (```)

**Pattern to Follow**:

1. If your content has NO triple backticks inside → use triple backticks (```)
2. If your content HAS triple backticks inside → use quadruple backticks (````)
3. Always close with the same number of backticks you opened with

### Mermaid Diagram Guidelines

**CRITICAL - Use Mermaid for All Flow Diagrams**:
When creating any type of flow diagram, architecture diagram, sequence diagram, or process flow, you MUST use Mermaid syntax instead of plain text diagrams.

**When to Use Mermaid**:

- Workflows and process flows
- System architecture diagrams
- Hierarchical structures (org charts, component trees)
- Sequence diagrams (interactions between components)
- State diagrams
- Data flow diagrams
- Any visual representation of relationships or flows

**Common Mermaid Diagram Types**:

1. **Flowcharts** - For workflows and process flows:

   ```mermaid
   graph TD
       A[Start] --> B{Decision}
       B -->|Yes| C[Process A]
       B -->|No| D[Process B]
       C --> E[End]
       D --> E
   ```

   - Use `graph TD` (top-down) or `graph LR` (left-right)
   - Use `graph TB` for top-bottom flows

2. **Sequence Diagrams** - For interactions and event flows:

   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
       participant User
       participant API
       participant DB

       User->>API: Request
       API->>DB: Query
       DB->>API: Response
       API->>User: Result
   ```

3. **Hierarchical Diagrams** - For tree structures:

   ```mermaid
   graph TD
       Manager[Manager Agent] --> A[Agent A]
       Manager --> B[Agent B]
       Manager --> C[Agent C]
   ```

4. **Parallel Execution Flows**:
   ```mermaid
   graph TB
       Start[Start] --> A[Task A]
       Start --> B[Task B]
       A --> End[Merge]
       B --> End
   ```

**Mermaid Best Practices**:

- Always use descriptive node labels
- Use `<br/>` for line breaks in node labels (e.g., `Node[Line 1<br/>Line 2]`)
- Keep diagrams simple and readable
- Use appropriate arrow types:
  - `-->` for standard flow
  - `->>` for sequence diagram messages
  - `-.->` for optional/conditional paths
- Add text to edges when needed: `A -->|label| B`

**Example - Before vs After**:

❌ **WRONG** (plain text):

```
User Request
    ↓
API Gateway → Service A → Database
    ↓
Response
```

✅ **CORRECT** (Mermaid):

```mermaid
graph TD
    User[User Request] --> API[API Gateway]
    API --> Service[Service A]
    Service --> DB[Database]
    DB --> Service
    Service --> API
    API --> User
```

**Multi-language Considerations**:

- Use the target language for node labels and text
- Keep technical terms in English when appropriate (e.g., "API", "Database")
- Ensure consistency across all language versions of the same diagram

### Language-Specific Notes

- **Korean**: Use 존댓말 (formal polite), mix Korean and English technical terms naturally
- **Japanese**: Use です/ます体 (polite form), use katakana for technical terms
- **English**: Use American English spelling, standard technical documentation style
- **Chinese**: Use simplified Chinese (简体中文), professional technical writing style, mix Chinese and English technical terms appropriately

## Image Generation Integration

### Hero Image Requirements

- Dimensions: 1020x510px (2:1 ratio) recommended
- Format: WebP, AVIF, or JPG
- File naming: `[slug]-hero.[ext]`
- Location: `src/assets/blog/`
- Frontmatter path: `../../../assets/blog/[slug]-hero.[ext]` (relative to content file)

### Image Prompt Guidelines

**IMPORTANT**: The Writing Assistant MUST generate context-aware, detailed image prompts following the **YAML 7-Part Structure** defined in `.claude/guidelines/image-prompt-guidelines.md`. Every prompt must be unique to the specific post content.

**📋 MANDATORY**: Before writing any image prompt, read `.claude/guidelines/image-prompt-guidelines.md` for the full YAML structure, domain-specific templates, high-scoring patterns, and the self-check process.

#### Prompt Generation Process (YAML 7-Part Structure):

1. **Design in YAML first** with all 7 parts:
   - **Tone**: 5 mood keywords (e.g., `"知的, 計画的, 精密, エンジニアリング, 設計図"`)
   - **Visual Identity**: Background/Text/Accent colors with HEX codes + names
   - **Image Style**: Features, Shapes, Texture, Composition, Effects
   - **Typography**: Heading style + application method
   - **Content Connection**: Core Concept, Visual Metaphor, Key Elements from the post
   - **Constraints**: No text overlay, no watermarks, 2:1 ratio
   - **Self-Check**: 3-point verification (uniqueness, specificity, consistency)

2. **Convert YAML to English prompt** for `generate_image.js`:
   ```
   A [Tone keywords] illustration of [Features description].
   [Shapes] arranged in [Composition]. [Texture] with [Effects].
   Color palette: [Background], [Accent colors].
   [Content Connection: Visual Metaphor].
   No text overlay. No watermarks. 2:1 aspect ratio.
   ```

3. **Self-check before generating** (must pass all 3):
   - "Could this prompt be used for a completely different blog post?" → If yes, Content Connection is missing. Rewrite.
   - "Can two people read this prompt and produce similar images?" → If no, Shapes/Texture/Composition is too vague. Add detail.
   - "Do the Tone keywords align with the Color Palette and Image Style?" → If contradiction exists, fix it.

#### Examples:

**❌ BAD (No YAML structure, generic)**:
```
A modern, professional illustration representing TypeScript.
```

**✅ GOOD (Full YAML design → converted to English prompt)**:

YAML Design:
```yaml
Tone: "構築的, 型安全, 堅牢, 精密, アーキテクチャ"
Visual Identity:
  Background: "#FFFFFF (White)"
  Text Color: "#3178C6 (TypeScript Blue)"
  Accent Colors:
    - "#E8E8E8 (Light Gray) — コードブロック"
    - "#00C853 (Green) — 型安全を示す盾"
Image Style:
  Features: "TypeScriptの型定義がビルディングブロックとして積み重なる設計図"
  Shapes: "接続されたノード, <T>のジェネリック型パラメータ, 盾のシンボル"
  Texture: "方眼グリッドの背景, クリーンなベクター"
  Composition: "中央のTSロゴから放射状に型定義が広がり、左から右へ推論フローが流れる"
Content Connection:
  Core Concept: "TypeScript型システムによるコンパイル時エラー防止"
  Visual Metaphor: "壊れた鎖(ランタイムエラー)が堅固なリンク(コンパイル時チェック)に置き換わる"
  Key Elements: "ジェネリック型<T>, 型ガード, 型推論の矢印"
```

English Prompt:
```
A structured, type-safe, architectural blueprint illustration of TypeScript type definitions stacking as building blocks. Connected nodes with generic type parameter "<T>" symbols radiating from a central TypeScript logo, with arrows showing type inference flow left to right. Shield symbols representing type safety, broken chains being replaced by solid links. Grid paper background in white, TypeScript blue (#3178C6) as primary, light gray (#E8E8E8) for code blocks, green (#00C853) for safety shields. Clean vector texture. No text overlay. No watermarks. 2:1 aspect ratio blog hero image.
```

#### Domain-Specific Prompt Templates:

**For AI/ML topics**:

- Neural network visualizations, brain-computer interfaces, data streams
- Futuristic, high-tech aesthetic with neon accents
- Abstract representations of learning/intelligence

**For Performance/Optimization topics**:

- Speed metaphors (rockets, lightning, streamlined shapes)
- Before/after comparisons, optimization graphs
- Minimal, clean design emphasizing efficiency

**For Architecture/System Design topics**:

- Isometric building blocks, blueprint style
- Connected systems, data flow diagrams
- Professional blueprint or technical drawing aesthetic

**For Process/Workflow topics**:

- Timeline or flowchart representations
- Step-by-step visual progression
- Organized, structured layout with clear hierarchy

**For Security topics**:

- Lock, shield, fortress metaphors
- Layered protection visualization
- Dark theme with trust-building elements

**For Web Development topics**:

- Browser windows, responsive layouts
- HTML/CSS/JS visual representations
- Colorful, modern web design aesthetic

#### Additional Requirements:

- **Always avoid text in the image** (no code snippets, no labels)
- **Match the blog post's complexity level** (simple for beginner content, sophisticated for advanced)
- **Consider cultural context** for multi-language posts (use universal visual language)
- **Ensure brand consistency** while being creative
- **Think about thumbnail appeal** (will it look good at small sizes?)

## Error Handling

### Common Issues

1. **Invalid language code**: Show available options (ko, ja, en, zh)
2. **Missing topic**: Display usage instructions
3. **File write failure**: Check directory permissions
4. **Schema validation error**: Verify frontmatter format
5. **Image generation failure**: Fall back to default placeholder

### Validation Checks

- Topic is not empty
- Language codes are valid (ko, ja, en, zh)
- Tags contain only alphanumeric and hyphens
- Generated slug is URL-safe
- All required frontmatter fields present

## Post-Generation Tasks

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Review Content**:

   ```bash
   # Open generated files in editor
   code src/content/blog/[slug].md
   ```

2. **Type Check**:

   ```bash
   npm run astro check
   ```

3. **Preview Locally**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Visit http://localhost:4321/blog/[slug]
   ```

4. **Edit if Needed**:

   - Refine technical details
   - Adjust code examples
   - Update SEO description
   - Crop/replace hero image

5. **Build & Deploy**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```
