# Write GA Analysis Post Command

## Description
Automatically generates comprehensive Google Analytics analysis reports as blog posts with multi-language support. This command orchestrates the Analytics Reporter and Improvement Tracker agents to create data-driven, publication-ready analytics posts.

## Usage

```bash
/write-ga-post <analysis-date> [options]
```

## Parameters

### Required
- `analysis-date` (YYYY-MM-DD): The end date of the analysis period. The command will automatically determine the analysis period based on the previous report.

### Optional
- `--period` (string): Override automatic period detection (e.g., "weekly", "monthly", "quarterly")
  - `weekly`: Last 7 days
  - `monthly`: Last 30 days
  - `quarterly`: Last 90 days
  - `custom`: Requires --start-date parameter
- `--start-date` (YYYY-MM-DD): Start date for custom period (requires --period custom)
- `--languages` (string): Comma-separated language codes (default: "ko,ja,en")
- `--skip-improvement-tracking` (boolean): Skip automatic TODO creation from action plan

## Examples

```bash
# Basic usage (weekly report)
/write-ga-post 2025-10-14

# Monthly report
/write-ga-post 2025-10-31 --period monthly

# Custom period
/write-ga-post 2025-10-14 --period custom --start-date 2025-10-01

# Korean only
/write-ga-post 2025-10-14 --languages ko

# Skip TODO creation (just generate report)
/write-ga-post 2025-10-14 --skip-improvement-tracking
```

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Period Determination and Data Collection

#### 1.1 Determine Analysis Period
```markdown
Algorithm:
1. Read all existing analytics reports from src/content/blog/ko/
2. Find the most recent report by pubDate
3. Calculate period:
   - If no previous report: Use blog launch date (2025-10-06) as start
   - If weekly/monthly specified: Use fixed period
   - If custom: Use provided --start-date
   - Default: From (previous report pubDate + 1 day) to analysis-date
```

#### 1.2 Invoke Analytics Reporter Agent
```markdown
Delegate to @analytics-reporter with context:

Context:
- Analysis Period: [start-date] to [analysis-date]
- Report Type: [weekly/monthly/quarterly/custom]
- Previous Report: [path to last report, if exists]
- Property ID: 395101361 (www.jangwook.net)

Task:
1. Collect GA4 data for the period using MCP tools
2. Run all essential queries (8 queries from agent guidelines):
   - Period Overview
   - Top Content Performance
   - Traffic Sources
   - Geographic Distribution
   - Device & Browser
   - New vs Returning
   - Landing Pages
   - Real-time Activity (optional)

3. Analyze data:
   - Compare vs previous period (week-over-week, month-over-month)
   - Compare vs KPI targets from analytics-strategy.md
   - Identify wins, warnings, insights, opportunities

4. Generate comprehensive analysis report with:
   - Executive Summary
   - KPI Performance (with status indicators)
   - Traffic Analysis
   - Content Performance
   - Audience Insights
   - Key Insights (3-5 insights with data, analysis, implications, recommendations)
   - Action Plan (High/Medium/Strategic priority)
   - Next Report Preview

5. Return structured data for blog post generation
```

    "total": 5,
    "categories": {"UX": 2, "SEO": 2, "Technical": 1},
    "avgImpact": "+23%"
  }
}
```

    }
    // ... more posts
  ],
  "summary": {
    "total": 3,
    "topTags": ["AI", "React", "TypeScript"]

```

#### 3.2 Generate Frontmatter

**Publication Date Calculation**:

Algorithm:
1. Find most recent blog post across all languages in src/content/blog/
2. Extract latest pubDate
3. Add 1 day ‚Üí new post's pubDate
4. Format: 'YYYY-MM-DD' (single quotes required)
```

**Frontmatter Template**:
```yaml
---
title: "[Í∏∞Í∞Ñ] Î∏îÎ°úÍ∑∏ Î∂ÑÏÑù Î¶¨Ìè¨Ìä∏: [ÌïµÏã¨ Ïù∏ÏÇ¨Ïù¥Ìä∏ ÏöîÏïΩ]"
description: "[Í∏∞Í∞Ñ] GA Îç∞Ïù¥ÌÑ∞ Î∂ÑÏÑù, ÏΩòÌÖêÏ∏† ÏÑ±Í≥º, Í∞úÏÑ† Ìö®Í≥º - Ìà¨Î™ÖÌïòÍ≤å Í≥µÏú†ÌïòÎäî Î∏îÎ°úÍ∑∏ ÏÑ±Ïû• Í∏∞Î°ù"
pubDate: '[YYYY-MM-DD]'  # Latest post + 1 day
heroImage: "../../../assets/blog/ga-analytics-report-hero.png"
tags: ["Analytics", "Report", "Data"]
---
```

#### 3.3 Generate Content for Each Language

**Delegation Pattern**:
```markdown
For each language in --languages (default: ko, ja, en):

Context to Writing Assistant:

- Improvement data (from improvement-history.astro)
- Blog post data (from README.md)
- Report structure (from Phase 3.1)
- Frontmatter template (from Phase 3.2)
- Target language: [ko/ja/en]

Task:
1. Generate complete blog post in target language
2. Follow analytics report structure
3. Include all data tables and charts
4. Translate insights and recommendations appropriately
5. Maintain technical term consistency
6. Add language-specific formatting

  - Weekly: weekly-analytics-2025-10-14.md
  - Monthly: monthly-analytics-2025-10.md
  - Quarterly: quarterly-analytics-Q4-2025.md
```

**Content Style Guidelines**:
- **Data-driven**: Every claim backed by GA4 data

## Error Handling

### Common Issues

1. **Invalid date format**:
   ```
   Error: Date must be in YYYY-MM-DD format
   Solution: Use format like 2025-10-14
   ```

2. **No previous report found**:
   ```
   Warning: No previous report detected. Using blog launch date (2025-10-06) as baseline.
   ‚Üí Proceeds with blog launch date as start of period
   ```

3. **GA4 MCP connection failure**:
   ```
   Error: Cannot connect to GA4 MCP
   Solution: Check MCP configuration and API permissions
   ```

4. **Insufficient data for period**:
   ```
   Warning: Less than 7 days of data available
   ‚Üí Generates report with available data and notes limitations
   ```

5. **Improvement history not found**:
   ```
   Warning: improvement-history.astro not found or empty
   ‚Üí Generates report without improvement section
   ```

### Validation Checks
- Date is valid YYYY-MM-DD format
- End date is not in the future
- Period has sufficient data (>= 1 day)
- Language codes are valid (ko, ja, en)
- GA4 Property ID is correct (395101361)
- MCP tools are accessible

## Advanced Usage

/write-ga-post 2025-10-14 --languages ko

# English + Japanese (for international audience)
/write-ga-post 2025-10-14 --languages en,ja
```

### Skip TODO Creation (Report Only)
```bash
# Generate report without action tracking
/write-ga-post 2025-10-14 --skip-improvement-tracking

# Useful for:
# - Monthly executive summaries
# - Historical analysis
# - Data exploration without action items
```

## Configuration

### Customization
Future enhancements may include:
- Custom KPI targets per report
- A/B test result integration
- Campaign-specific analysis
- Automated report scheduling
- Email/Slack notifications

## Notes

- **All dates must use 'YYYY-MM-DD' format with single quotes**
- Report slug generated from period and type
- Analysis always compares vs previous period
- Action plan automatically prioritized by impact/effort
- Improvements are correlated with traffic changes
- New posts are highlighted and analyzed
- Generated content should be reviewed before publishing
- Reports follow transparent, educational style
- Data is the hero, not vanity metrics

## Troubleshooting

### Report Not Generating
- Check GA4 MCP connection
- Verify Property ID (395101361)
- Ensure date format is correct (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Check if previous report exists for period calculation

### Missing Data Sections
- Verify improvement-history.astro is accessible
- Check README.md exists and is formatted correctly
- Ensure GA4 has data for the specified period

### Build Errors
- Run `npm run astro check` to validate schema
- Check frontmatter format (YAML syntax)
- Verify hero image path is correct
- Ensure all required frontmatter fields present

### Incorrect Period Calculation
- Manually specify period with --period and --start-date
- Check previous report pubDate is correct
- Verify blog launch date (2025-10-06) if no previous reports
