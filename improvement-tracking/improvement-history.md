## 💡 Lessons Learned Library

### From Blog Launch (Oct 6, 2025)

#### ✅ What Worked Well
1. **GA4 Data Pipeline Understanding**
   - Learned difference between realtime vs historical data
   - Understood 24-48hr processing delay
   - Successfully integrated MCP for automated queries
   - *Takeaway*: Plan for data lag in launch schedules

2. **Transparent Communication**
   - Published analysis report despite limited data
   - Openly shared limitations and learning process
   - Built trust with "투명성 선언" approach
   - *Takeaway*: Honesty > Perfect metrics

3. **Initial UX Signals**
   - Multi-page navigation confirmed good structure
   - EffiFlow project page attracted most attention
   - User journey shows content discovery working
   - *Takeaway*: Portfolio content is valuable hook

4. **Baseline Establishment**
   - Set realistic, time-bound KPIs (M3/M6/M12)
   - Aligned with industry benchmarks
   - Created measurable success criteria
   - *Takeaway*: Can't improve what you don't measure

#### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement Identified
1. **Mobile Traffic Gap**
   - Very low mobile visitors in initial data
   - Desktop-dominated traffic pattern
   - *Action*: TODO-002 (Mobile optimization)

2. **Geographic Concentration**
   - Japan-only traffic in early data
   - Need multi-region strategy
   - *Action*: Multi-language content expansion

3. **Limited Event Tracking**
   - Only basic pageview tracking active
   - Missing user behavior insights
   - *Action*: TODO-001 (Event tracking enhancement)

#### 📚 Best Practices Discovered
1. **MCP Query Patterns**
   - Use `run_realtime_report` for immediate insights (0-5 min lag)
   - Use `run_report` for historical trends (24-48hr lag)
   - Always include `order_bys` for meaningful data
   - Filter with `dimension_filter` for specific analysis
   - *Reusable*: Query templates documented in blog post

2. **Analytics Workflow**
   - Daily: 5-min realtime check
   - Weekly: 30-min report review
   - Monthly: 2-hour strategy session
   - *Reusable*: Time allocation framework

3. **Content Strategy**
   - Blog posts: 2-3 per week (sustainable velocity)
   - SEO-optimized titles & meta descriptions (non-negotiable)
   - Project case studies attract engagement
   - *Reusable*: Content creation template

### What Didn't Work
- *To be populated as improvements are tested and some fail*
- *Failure is data - we'll document it transparently*

### Reusable Patterns
- *To be extracted from successful improvements*
- *Pattern library will grow with each success*
