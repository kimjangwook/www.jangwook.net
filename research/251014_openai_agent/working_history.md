## Key Findings Summary

### Technical Architecture
- **Visual workflow builder** with drag-and-drop nodes
- **Multi-agent orchestration** with conditional logic
- **Built-in safety** with Guardrails
- **Version control** and evaluation tools

### Deployment Options
1. **ChatKit**: Fastest, OpenAI-hosted, best for MVP
2. **Advanced**: Self-hosted, full control, for enterprises
3. **SDK Only**: Maximum flexibility, custom UI

### Success Metrics
